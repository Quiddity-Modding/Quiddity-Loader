# Quiddity Loader

A Minecraft mod-loader that loads *Ruby* based mod scripts. This is an experimental loader where it can load and mod a 
large range of Minecraft versions without updating. The idea is that the only updating that would be needed is to add 
new features to the loader.

##*This is mostly an experiment at the moment*
**Do not expect anything staying the same or to work**
